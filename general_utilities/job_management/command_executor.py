    For future developers: Why did Eugene create this seemingly stupid piece of code? Three reasons:

    1. The previous general_utilities.association_resources.run_cmd() method (that may or may not still exist) was
    inflexible with regard to running tests / prototyping OUTSIDE DNANexus.

    2. run_cmd() had to be parameterized during each use. That meant that one had to remember the exact Docker image to
    use at each invocation and the mount points within that image.

    3. Each module had to independently download a specified Docker image. While not a big deal, I wanted to modularise
    this process and make a call-out so code wasn't duplicated.
